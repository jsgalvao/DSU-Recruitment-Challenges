    "The Dow Jones [Industrial] Index (DJIA) is a stock market index founded in February 16, 1885, as DJA, and renamed to DJIA in May 26, 1896. Nowadays, the index comprises 30 blue chip companies listed on the New York stock exchange and the Nasdaq. These companies operate on industries ranging from information technology or financial services to retailing or food industry, to name a few. The largest index weight is held by UnitedHealth Group, at 8.81%, followed closely by Microsoft and Goldman Sachs at 6.83% and 6.54%, respectively. It also includes other internationally recognised companies, such as Apple, McDonald's and Visa, for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike other common indexes, the Dow Jones Index is price-weighted, as opposed to being weighted by market capitalisation. As such, stocks with higher share prices have a greater influence. The DJIA is calculated by dividing the sum of the prices of all component stocks, $\\sum p$, by the Dow Divisor, $d$. As of February 2024, the Dow Divisor was set at 0.15265312230608.\n",
